Absolutely! Let's build a 4-month plan to bridge the gap between your current skills and the requirements for the Pagoda position. Keep in mind, this is an ambitious plan. Consistency and adaptability are key!

**Fundamentals**

Before diving into advanced topics, ensure you have a rock-solid grasp of core Rust and JavaScript concepts. 

**Overall Plan Structure**

* **Months 1 & 2:** Focus on solidifying fundamentals and core concepts.
* **Months 3 & 4:** Introduce blockchain-specific knowledge, work on projects, and refine your skills.

**Month 1**

* **Week 1:  Rust Deep Dive**
    * **Daily:** Complete chapters of "The Rust Programming Language" book ([https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)). Focus on ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, error handling.
    * **Projects:** Build small command-line tools in Rust to apply these concepts. 
* **Week 2: Algorithms & Data Structures**
    * **Daily:** Study a well-regarded online course or book. Implement core algorithms and data structures (sorting, searching, trees, graphs) in both Rust and JavaScript.
* **Week 3: Concurrency Fundamentals** 
    * **Daily:** Read about threads, processes, mutexes, semaphores. Complete tutorials or chapters of a book dedicated to concurrency with emphasis on examples in your chosen languages.
    * **Project:** Write a multithreaded program in Rust, addressing synchronization and potential race conditions. 
* **Week 4: Parallelism Fundamentals**
    * **Daily:** Dive into parallel programming concepts (task/data parallelism, SIMD). Learn tools like Rayon (Rust) or Web Workers (JavaScript).
    * **Project:** Parallelize an existing algorithm and measure performance differences.

**Month 2**

* **Week 5: Rust Mastery**
   * **Daily:**  "Rust By Example" ([https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)),  advanced books, build increasingly complex Rust projects.
* **Week 6: JavaScript Concurrency** 
    * **Daily:** Explore asynchronous programming in JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await).  Build small projects illustrating how these patterns work.
* **Week 7: System Design for Distributed Systems**
    * **Daily:**  Research patterns, tradeoffs in distributed systems (CAP theorem, consensus algorithms). Resources like [https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview). 
* **Week 8:  Project Focus**
     * **Daily** Start developing a larger project combining concurrency, Rust, maybe frontend JavaScript skills. This could be anything from a simulation to a game. It's key to manage scope.

**Month 3 & 4** 
 
* **Blockchain Exploration:** Dive into blockchain specifics, research NEAR protocol documentation, build small demos on their network.
* **Focus on Node Operations:** Understand how nodes are set up, monitored, and optimized (relevant to the Pagoda job).
* **Open-Source Contributions:** Find projects in the NEAR ecosystem to contribute to. Even small bug fixes or documentation improvements help you gain experience.
* **Mock Interviews:**  Practice coding interviews relevant to this role.

**Important Notes:**

* **Adapt:** Modify based on your pace. If something proves harder, spend more time. The reverse is also true.
* **Communities:** Find Rust/blockchain communities (Discord, subreddits) for help and motivation.. 
* **Showcase:** Blog about your projects, learnings, and progress. Potential employers love this!

**Let me know if you want to focus on a specific area further and we can create additional tasks!**
