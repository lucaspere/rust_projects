# Day 8: Improvements Linked List & Arrays - 23-03-2024

Absolutely! I'll aim to provide exercises that complement your learning from "Grokking Algorithms" and push your Rust skills.

**Day 8: Linked Lists & Arrays**

**Alongside "Grokking Algorithms" Chapter 2**

Focus: Core linked list operations, memory representation differences, and basic array handling.

**Practice Problems**

**Rust Challenges**

1.  **Middle Insertion Plus:**  Modify your linked list implementation to support inserting *after* a specific existing node (identified by value). Consider how to handle cases where the target value might not be found.
2.  **Deletion Dilemma:** Implement deletion of a node from your linked list. Explore:
    *   Deleting by value 
    *   Deleting by position (e.g., the 3rd node in the list).
